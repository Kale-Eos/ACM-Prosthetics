# ACM-Prosthetics

Hello everyone!

Welcome to __ACM Prosthetics__ hosted by the __Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)__ at __California State University, Long Beach__.
Here we develop and program code primarily for ongoing and future prosthetic-based projects for/by ACM.
The code however may be utilized for other projects in robotics, automated system analysis, and other areas of programmable implementation as well.
The code written here is based on current knowledge of it's members and is open to variations and/or translation into other programmable languages.
These files are code that are refined and optimized to eliminate delay and provide unique and specific features that possible designs may request for prosthetics and other various project topics. 

Starting in the CSULB Fall semester of 2018 it is led currently by one of ACM's project managers,
