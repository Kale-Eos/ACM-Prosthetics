# Laser Cutter files

These files should be imported to a laser cutter to build the 2D Design Hand.

## Building

For the version created with the laser cutter, we used Plexiglas (acrylic) because it is low-cost, light-weight, it can be easily found, it has good durability, significant ultimate tensile strength (8.500 - 11.250 psi) and almost the same density (1.19 gr / cubic cm | 0.043 lbs / cubic inch), with other common plastics like ABS. The laser cutting machine used, was the Universal Laser Systems VSL 3.5 that appears in the following image. The estimated fabrication time with the laser cutter is ~ 2 hrs.
