# 3D Printed Parts

These parts should be printed to build the 3D Design Hand.

## Building

For the 3D printed version we used ABS and more precisely red and white 3 mm filaments with the Lulzbot TAZ 4, 3D Printer that appears in the following image. The estimated fabrication time with the 3D printer is ~ 6 hrs.
